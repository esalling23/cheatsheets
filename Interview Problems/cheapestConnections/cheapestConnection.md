## The Problem

This problem was asked by Airbnb.

You are given a huge list of airline ticket prices between different cities around the world on a given day. These are all direct flights. Each element in the list has the format `(source_city, destination, price)`.

Consider a user who is willing to take up to `k` connections from their origin city `A` to their destination `B`. Find the cheapest fare possible for this journey and print the itinerary for that journey.

### Examples

For example, our traveler wants to go from `JFK` to `LAX` with up to `3` connections, and our input flights are as follows:

```
[
    ('JFK', 'ATL', 150),
    ('ATL', 'SFO', 400),
    ('ORD', 'LAX', 200),
    ('LAX', 'DFW', 80),
    ('JFK', 'HKG', 800),
    ('ATL', 'ORD', 90),
    ('JFK', 'LAX', 500),
]
```

Due to some improbably low flight prices, the cheapest itinerary would be `JFK -> ATL -> ORD -> LAX`, costing `$440`.
