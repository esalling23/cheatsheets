2. Drag your font file into the Resources folder (but not the Fonts folder!
3. Open Window → TextMesh Pro → Font Asset Creator
4. In Source Font File, choose the ttf file you just copied
5. Click Generate Font Atlas (yet another clear and intuitive name there)
6. Click Save.
7. Navigate to Resource/Fonts, and click Save again.
8. Now you can use it in your TextMeshPro objects.
