## Tips

### Debug Mode

In the "inspector" tab, select the three dots and choose "Debug" instead of "Normal". This will reveal extra information such as private variables that usually would be hidden in the inspector.

### Empty GameObjects

Tip: Add an icon for the game object so you can see it in the scene view even if it's empty.
