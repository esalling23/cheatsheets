# Unity basics

## Game Engine Terminology

> "Inside a game engine, you don’t create assets — the objects and sounds that are the building blocks of the interactive experience. Instead, assets are created in specialized external programs called **Digital Content Creation (DCC)** tools. Many DCCs are integrated with Unity to ease the process of importing them. 

    - **3D DCCs** are programs for creating 3D models, animated characters, and environments; examples: Maya, ZBrush, and Blender. 
    - **2D DCCs**: programs for creating 2D images, illustrations, textures, and interfaces; examples: Photoshop, Illustrator, Substance Painter, and Gimp.
    - **Audio DCCs**: programs for recording, editing, and mixing sound effects and music; examples: Audition, Logic Pro, Reaper, and Audacity. 
    - **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**: programs for writing code in a variety of languages; examples: Visual Studio and Rider
    - **Real-time Engines**: programs for real-time development, rendering, and publishing of 3D content or applications; examples: Unity and Unreal"
