# Find number of 3 values that are a geometric progression of a given ratio

Geometric progression means values are in increasing order & changing by multiplyingthe previous value by the common ratio

> Example: 2, 6, 18, 54 uses a common ratio of 3
> because 2 * 3 = 6, then 6 * 3 = 18, and 18 * 3 = 54 

### Question: Will the triplet values be in order?
They will NOT be in order but will be ascending in the array

> Example: 1, 2, 2, 4 has 2 triplets of (1, 2, 4)
> at indices (0, 1, 3) and (0, 2, 3)
