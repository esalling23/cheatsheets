A snail is trying to get out of a 30 foot well and it starts at the bottom. Every day it moves up 3 feet, and every night it slides down 2 feet. On what day does the snail get out of the well?

30 ft

-> 3ft
<- 2ft

+ 1ft every day

29 days -> 30ft
3
-2
day 1: +3 - 2 = 1
day 2: 1 +3 - 2 = 2
day 3: 

day N: (N - 1) +3 - 2

30ft 

3ft = 1 day
4ft = 2 day

30ft = (3ft * n) - (2ft * (n - 1))

3 day = 3ft * 3 - 2ft * 2

5ft = 3 days

30ft = 28 days

day 27 at 27ft then go up 3 reach the top so 28 days

Assume you have an oddly shaped 3 gallon container, an oddly shaped 5 gallon container, and an unlimited supply of water. How do you get exactly 4 gallons?

5 - 3 = 2

5 - 1 = 4

Assume you have a regular deck of 52 cards and are dealt 5 cards. What is the probability that you were dealt a flush?

Flush = 5 are the same suit
52 / 4 = 13 cards share a suit

13 / 52 = probability of pulling any suit

1 / 20 chance 

1/4^5

for a heart flush: 

FOR ANY: 12/51 * 11/50 * 10/49 * 9/48 * 8/47 etc



1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8
